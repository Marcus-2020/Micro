## Micro - a simple ERP for simple business

> This projects is in it's starting fase, more will be added every week

This project is me trying to learn a lot of new programing concepts and applying in something I undestand about, 
I have being developing ERPs for the past three years and this will be my sandbox for learning and sharing what I learned.

The idea is to build a simple ERP, managerial only, that can do some basic operations like:
- Creating and editing products
- Creating and managing storages/inventory of those products
- Creating sales and purchases
- This sales and purchases interacting with the inventory system

I want to be able to experiment with some techniches and tecnologies:
- Modular Monolith at first
- Microsservice experiement after
- Intermodule communication using events through messaging (RabittMQ)
- Caching with Redis
- Logging and telemetry with Serilog and OpenTelemetry

That's it for the start, maybe new thing will come up.
